## Problem?

I'm a software engineer and a tech consultant in various companies. My daily job is to design, discuss and build web projects and micro-service architectures.
However, there is one thing I don't really like - once a month I need to sit for the whole day and start preparing reports, invoices, bills, sending it over. Also, every day I need to report "timings" in a dedicated customer's software, e.g. Jira.
To help with that task I have multiple paid tools and still spend 1 whole day a month with it:
- Jira, Toggle, Invoicing software, Business account software, Slack, Email.

## Idea

This is a demo project to automate daily routines of consultancy agent (developer).

- track time over different platform, which you're comfortable with.
- synchronize tracked time entries with a customer's software, e.g. Jira, YouTrack.
- create regular (monthly, weekly) time reports in a PDF.
- create regular invoices (monthly, weekly) in a PDF.
- send reports/invoices over various of channels, e.g. slack, email.
- reconcline invoices with a business account to mark that money is received and invoice is paid.
- tax reporting - once a year we need to sign and send special report to the tax services.

## MVP
As a first thing, I've crafted a [cli application](https://github.com/timemate/toggl-sync), which can be executed on a developer's computer and in the background do a very simple thing:
- fetch data from Toggle
- synchronize it with Jira.
